OMT-G Designer
==============

[OMT-G Designer](http://www.aqui.io/omtg/) is an online diagramming application for the design of geographic database systems and applications based on OMT-G, an object-oriented data model for geographic applications. It aims to increase the practical and academic uses of this data model, by providing an open and platform-independent modeling resource. [2]

The tool provides various consistency checks on the integrity of the schema, and includes a function that maps OMT-G geographic conceptual schemas into physical schemas of PostgreSQL/PostGIS and Oracle Spatial, including the necessary spatial integrity constraints.

OMT-G Model
-----------

The OMT-G (Object Modeling Technique for Geographic Applications) is an object oriented data model for the design of geographic applications and geographic database systems. It provides primitives for modeling the geometric shape and location of geographic objects, supporting spatial and topological relationships, "whole-part" structures, networks, and multiple representations of objects and spatial relationships. The OMT-G data model reduces the distance between the conceptual project and the physical implementation of geographic applications, by allowing a more precise definition of the required objects, operations and visualization parameters.
